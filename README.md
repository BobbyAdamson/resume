## Experience

### Shopify Logistics (6 River Systems)
#### Senior Software Engineer
_January 2022 - May 2023_

[Website](https://6river.com)

**Technologies:**
Typescript, React, Jest, GraphQL, Nest, Rush

As a member of the internal tools team for Shopify Logistics (6 River Systems acquired by Shopify) I worked on features to help our most advanced users configure and maintain warehouse systems for customers like Disney, Shopify, DHL, Create & Barrel, and more

- Technical lead on multi-quarter projects that delivered ahead of schedule
- Redesigned team process to align better with an agile methodology leading to more frequent releases (from one release every ~8 weeks to once every week or two)
- Lead the charge for improved automated test coverage in our primary control center application from essentially 0% to 54% in our final 8 months. (Jest, Typescript, React)
    - Refactored many large scale methods and components into smaller units with single concerns leading to more thorough test coverage and a more readable codebase
- Lead the charge to enable our primarily front-end focused team to be capable in the backend of a critical application, reducing bottlenecks and blockers and relieving pressure on other teams
- Mentored and supported junior engineers

Unfortunately my time with 6 River Systems at Shopify was [cut short due to the sale of Shopify Logistics in large-scale, performance-agnostic cuts](https://news.shopify.com/important-team-and-business-changes).

## Education

### University of Missouri
#### Bachelor of Journalism - Strategic Communication/Advertising
_2009 - 2013_

Since I was having some level of success with software on my own, I decided to go to school for a supplemental skill by focusing on design and advertising. This worked well especially at the time because the "unicorn" developer (someone who could design and write code) was highly desireable. Eventually I realized I wanted focus on software.
